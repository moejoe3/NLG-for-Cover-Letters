It is also my intent to improve the quality of life for all employees by giving back during my own time with tips for personal financial management.
One of my primary focuses whilst working for Flagship Engineering was to cut costs without having to eliminate jobs. I initially faced challenges when faced with the possibility of budget cuts. I remained diligent in my objective without compromising the status quo as dictated by higher-ups about the alternative of layoffs. Once the company announced it was cut costs or lose jobs, the teams worked to implement the necessary changes.
In the end, I was able to find ways to eliminate budgets by 12% in each department and keep the jobs of four people. I also worked with department heads to reduce job redundancies and create new positions in areas that were lacking. This resulted in an increase in productivity of roughly 27%. I also implemented a personal finance program as a way to help all employees better save for their futures and make the most out of their paychecks. The results were a reported increase in overall job satisfaction by 37% and retention rates of 21% higher annually.

I kept the individuals under surveillance and alerted law enforcement. I was later recognized for being instrumental in their arrest and preventing the theft of $20,000 worth of company supplies. I look forward to using my observation skills as a valuable member of Retail Ocean.
Three years of experience as a military police officer and two years of experience as a retail sales associate provided me with the knowledge necessary to work as a Security Officer at Retail Ocean.

Because of my experience working in medical offices, I believe I would fit in well at your company.
From preparing reports and quarterly earnings statements in a timely, organized manner to implementing office procedures designed to improve efficiency and ensure data accuracy, my background in all aspects of office management in a medical setting has prepared me for this role. Solid leadership, time management and communication skills are among the additional strengths I would draw from if given the opportunity to be part of your team.
While working at Crossover Medical in a similar position, I accomplished the goal of optimizing revenue and minimizing billing errors in two key ways. First, I implemented an updated invoicing process by recommending the purchase of new software designed to track all invoices and flag late or incomplete payments so that such issues could be addressed ASAP. Secondly, I took the initiative to suggest a more efficient method of responding to and resolving client concerns, which resulted in a nearly 25% increase in repeat business over a one-year period.
Also while working at Crossover Medical, I frequently trained new office staff. During the training sessions I conducted, I routinely stressed the importance of efficiency and accuracy with coding. I was commended by upper management for contributing to a 21% increase in office staff retention during my seven years with the company.

By combining my previous experience at other stores with Centurion Foods systems and philosophies, I can help the store continue to financially grow and be a pillar of the community for employees and customers.

I also know that repeat business is the cornerstone to businesses that stand the test of time. There's always plenty of competition, so I refined the training process so that customers always received efficient and personable service.
I'm very aware that grocery stores need to keep their prices competitive to continually draw new customers in and retain the ones they already have. Because of this, we instituted a price-matching structure so that if a customer found an advertisement for the same product at another store for a lower price we would match that price.
Thank you for your time and for considering me for the Store Manager position at Centurion Foods. Constantly expanding my set of skills is of utmost importance to me, so I would be very glad to have the opportunity to continue to learn at a slightly different type of grocery store.

In my previous role as an assistant manager at Innovation Clothing Outlet, I helped the manager lead more than 100 employees over the span of four years.

By training new hires within the first month of their employment on how to work the point-of-sales stations, we were able to cut labor costs by 23%.
I believe that teamwork is of paramount importance and that communication should extend between shifts. That's why, with my manager's help, I implemented a communication log so that management and staff could tell each other about issues that arose throughout the day.

My previous work as a Field Technician has taught me many things not only in health care but in dealing with IT issues and working with all kinds of people.
My experience as a Field Technician was with Flagiship Enterprises, a company that retrieved patient medical records for the purpose of insurance company auditing. My job was to travel throughout my state, going to medical offices and hospitals to retrieve the requested records via flash drive and upload them to the company at the end of the day. My efficiency scores in past two years were at 94% and 97%.
There are still some doctors who use paper charts. In those cases, I would copy the needed information and then scan and upload it to my office. As a Field Technician, I used different software programs that are made especially for EMRs. With medical fraud becoming so prevalent, programs are getting harder to crack, which means they're safer for patient information.

I started as an EMT when I first graduated from high school. I wanted to be certified in something that mattered while I figured my life out. That was 10 years ago. Since then I have taken more training and became a paramedic five years ago. Training never stops, and that's one of the things that makes me love this job so much. I know I am helping my patients with some of the newest medical information around.
One of the areas of being a Paramedic that is so important is that we work in conjunction with the firehouses and the police department. When one of us needs help, someone is there. Fire and police personnel are often cross-trained in emergency medicine, which goes a long way when we are called to a motor vehicle accident or a house on fire. Sometimes we are all spread thin, and it takes every one of us to get the job done to save as many lives as possible.
At this point in my career, I am looking for stability. I know I may need to step down from all the hardcore action one of these days in the future. I might consider hospital administration down the road. Centurion Medical has such a strong reputation that I thought it would be a good place to work. Thank you for your time.

In my work, I like to combine a creative streak with a continuous drive for leanness and efficiency. I think that this combination makes me a perfect fit for this open position because I am always striving to find ways to optimize the performance of some existing industrial or manufacturing process and am not afraid to think in bold and original ways to do it. I am naturally a very systematic thinker and can always be relied upon to be precise and rigorous in every maintenance check or proposal for improvement.
Ever since I began my career in engineering at Centurion Industries, I have always remained aware that even the tiniest miscalculation could wreak havoc on an organization's established manufacturing processes. My education in mechanical engineering at Westwood University provided me with a strong foundation in physics and mathematics. While there, I learned to perform complex and important calculations quickly and accurately in my head — an ability that has always served me well in a pinch.
Still, I take care to check every calculation and supplement all design sketches with models created with computer-aided design software, like AutoCAD or SOLIDWORKS. In this way, I have been able to visualize what devices meant to improve manufacturing efficiency might look like and how they might function before actually implementing them. While at Centurion, the proposals that my team and I submitted ended up increasing steel production by 8% per annum.
I earnestly thank you for your time and attention in considering me for this position. Joining the tight-knit and talented community of engineers and technicians at Flagship would be a wonderful opportunity to develop my talents and do what I love to do. As we move forward in the hiring process, I hope to be able to show you that I belong on the team.

I worked on a team that was comprised of many different disciplines, which meant I needed to be cognizant of their respective expertise and know when to yield to their discretion. Working independently is also a strength of mine.
I have a strong work ethic, ability to handle multiple projects at once, and a yearning to never stop learning. Asking the right questions has also been a strong suit of mine so that the final product perfectly mirrors what the client is seeking to receive. Between my schooling at Coral Springs University and internship experience, I feel I am a highly qualified candidate for this position.
Thank you for your valuable time and consideration. I am sincerely looking forward to learning more details about the Mechanical Engineer position and about the great work that River Tech is conducting. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me in order to inquire further about any of my many qualifications listed on my resume. I look forward to speaking with you and the management team in the near future.

Getting the chance to seek employment with your company is certainly one of the highlights of my career, as I have followed all of your accomplishments since inception. As one of the leaders in the spheres of information technology, Crossover Software was very active in the local community of St. Helena University, where I completed my education.
During my four-year experience with Foundry Marketing, which is the last employer that I worked for, I managed the company's payroll system, ran constant updates, and facilitated smooth integration with other departments. I also helped switch to the middleman provider of direct deposit services that saved our business 29% in overhead costs over a two-year period. I further helped diagnose and resolve a weekly average of eight problems reported by employees from all sectors. Doing so allowed me to improve my critical thinking and professional communication skills.
Some of my priorities include fixing system errors within the payroll department's software, implementing more efficient methods of compensation, and approving employees' tax-related documentation. Additionally, I spent over 45 hours delivering weekly seminars covering the basic concepts of successful payroll integration to senior-level managers and multiple executives. Doing so helped me polish my public speaking skills and turn formal presentation into one of my strengths and passions.
Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I am grateful for the opportunity to apply to work for your organization. I believe that my skills can be an outstanding asset to Crossover Software. As you continue the hiring process, I look forward to communicating with you directly and going into more details about the Payroll Clerk position as well as some of my personal goals.

Throughout my career, I've developed my leadership skills and my ability to identify a business's most pressing needs so that I can fulfill them. I'm excited to have the opportunity to help Innovation Advertising meet its sales objectives.
In the course of my former position at Flagship Advertising, I was responsible for leading a multi-level sales task force. My team improved sales by 6.2% on a quarterly basis. My other duties consisted of creating customer service initiatives in conjunction with a pilot inventory management program. Following my execution of performance-oriented retail and customer service frameworks, more than 80% of surveyed customers stated that their retail experience had improved since the previous year.
I am a driven, focused individual always searching for ways to create and add value to the company, including the development of new strategies for marketing, customer service and sales. When I was a sales associate at Foundry Marketing, I pushed my colleagues to adopt a hands-on approach to customer service, which led to a 20% jump in annual revenue for the department.

I have also been told that I am attuned to people's body language, which further helps me identify people's motives and solve problems.
As part of my most recent role as Community Officer at the River Tech Police Department, I fostered relationships with employees at local public retail centers, such as gas stations, shops, and grocery stores. Community members in these roles can be eyes and ears for law enforcement, and gaining them as allies is helpful for obtaining leads during an investigation or while in pursuit of a suspect. It's also important to gain the trust of community members because they will be more likely to call and ask for assistance if they encounter a patron of their store who is being disruptive on their premises or in the community.
I am also attentive to procedures, and I am able to testify in cases that I have been involved with. My attention to detail has been noted on my performance appraisals, and I am often told that the reports that I write are impeccable and allow court proceedings to be conducted smoothly.

I've been working in the restaurant industry for the last 15 years, and I love serving guests and creating a one-of-a-kind experience for them every time they're at one of my tables. Anticipating the needs of my guests is of paramount importance to me because I love helping restaurants grow their clientele, and I believe that creating a fun and friendly experience is one of the factors that I have the most control over as a Waiter. I do, however, also believe that guests want their order to be served correctly and in a timely fashion. That's why I work to communicate effectively with cooks and help other Waiters by expediting and running their tables' food.
In my previous position at Innovation Restaurant, I served guests by greeting them as soon as they were seated and by serving their drinks, most of the time, within two minutes of them having ordered. Innovation Restaurant has a quality-assurance program that uses secret guests who rate their experiences at the restaurant. For both of the two secret guests that I served, I was given perfect scores on timeliness of service and menu knowledge. I also helped management refine the training program so that new Waiters would better learn how to serve their guests.
I'm attentive to details and pride myself on my ability to communicate effectively with kitchen staff, bar staff, hosts and other servers. I also understand the functions and concerns of several of these roles because I've also worked as a host and bartender.
I'm so excited at the opportunity to learn about the food at The Flagship Restaurant and to connect with the restaurant's other Waiters and the guests. If hired, I'll be happy to help others learn techniques that create quality experiences for guests, and I'll continually be looking for ways to improve the service that I give.

I possess a master's degree in social work from St. Helena University, and I graduated top of my class. I also received supervisory recognition for my field experience at Clearwater School District. During that tenure, I provided initial analysis for troubled youth, ongoing analysis of their behavior and recommendations for educational procedures and plans.
My experiences thus far in social work have made me keenly aware of how important it is to maintain accurate student records and meet deadlines for parent/staff meetings, as well as the importance of implementing individual student programs. I understand how to recognize student needs and make unique provisions when necessary and communicate with parents, even outside of normal school hours, to ensure that a positive and motivational environment exists beyond the classroom. I was responsible for assisting with a caseload of 200 students at the 12th-grade level, and my team helped improve the graduation rate by 10%.

I like making clients happy, but I love when I can give them something that they didn't even know they wanted. Getting to know clients and understand their needs is of utmost importance to me during the beginning stages of any project. I'm excited to get to know the other designers at Innovation Interior Design to continue to learn new techniques, and I would be so pleased to be able to bring my current experience to the company.
In my previous role at Flagship Designers, I worked with a wide variety of clientele, and I pride myself on being able to make almost anyone's budget work. Some clients only have a few thousand dollars per room, but other clients want a high-end design and have the budget for it. Even though some homeowners can't spend as much, it's still a priority for me to give them something that will be functional and aesthetically pleasing for years to come. Thankfully, there are many materials on the market today that I can use to create a high-end look without breaking the budget.
Although I completed my degree in interior design at Clearwater University several years ago, I also stay updated on the latest trends in interior design. It's extremely important to know which techniques and products will make a room look fresh and which ones will make rooms feel dated. That's why I spend five hours every week looking at some of the newer interior design books and researching the available products that manufacturers are making today.
I want to thank you for your time and for considering me for the Interior Designer position at Innovation Interior Design. I look forward to talking to you in person and talking more about the position.

During my time at Foundry Marketing, I was able to implement dozens of strategic relationships that grew the business by 37%. It was my ability to select the right potential partners and to find the ways our businesses complement one another rather than to be seen as competition that made such efforts a great success.
I spend much of my time working with the marketing and sales departments to learn everything I can about target markets and the analytics of sales and marketing campaigns. This helps me to determine whether or not target markets are right for products and services. By making target market shifts in the past, I have increased sales by 43% for some product lines and eliminated other products entirely due to poor performance. This resulted in saving the company $250,000 annually while improving branding to secure an additional 21 new business accounts valued at $2.5 million.

However, I combine this disposition of mine with a deep knowledge of medicine, biochemistry and toxicology, which was imparted to me during my time as a student at St. Helena Medical School where I got my BPharm and MPharm degrees. This means that I can be trusted to easily answer a wide range of questions that patients might have about their medication — questions about dosages, how often to take them, possible side effects and so on. I'm also quick with numbers and therefore able to give patients their medications in the correct doses reliably and efficiently.

In addition to my work experience, my education makes me an excellent candidate for the job. I earned my B.A. in early childhood education at Hawaii Western, and I minored in childhood development. While there, I served at my local church as a Sunday School teacher for fourth and fifth graders.
I have experience working as an assistant in the classroom. It was just the start I needed for this next jump. At the school, I was responsible for designing fun and engaging projects for the kids.

Every laborer has to adjust to ongoing regulations. I know that the construction industry becomes more complex each year and that keeping up with new training and education is important. I believe that we can manage the growing dynamic together. I bring you my experience in masonry, hydraulics, carpentry, plumbing, land grading and concrete molding.

After graduating, I stayed on at CSU to continue helping the staff. My position was upgraded, as were my responsibilities. This was the jump I was looking for. Helping the students with their own school and sports balance was a dream. It wasn't always easy, but that made it feel even better when results were witnessed.
My first big break came in the form of a full-time Assistant Coaching position at Hawaii Western. As an assistant, I was tasked with forming my own game plans, making in-game adjustments, and constantly teaching the kids what was necessary to find success. It isn't everyone who is as fortunate as me to be able to do what they love as a career. While that has remained true, my wish is to lead Green Valley State as Head Coach. This is a grand opportunity that fits into exactly what I have worked toward. You have a tremendous group of kids here, and I want to be a part of their growth into young men.

I would love nothing more than to channel my near-obsessive love for organization and books to this position.
While I have no direct work experience in the library science field, I have volunteered as the Library Assistant for Ms. Jenkins, the librarian at my high school, since I was in the eighth grade. For the most part, my job was to reshelve books, so I became very accustomed to the Dewey Decimal System as a point of interest and a necessity.

As someone who is detail-focused and has a flair for finances, I thrive on delivering innovative solutions that reduce costs and increase revenue. With more than eight years of experience as an accounting professional, I'm excited about the contributions I can make as a member of Cloud Clearwater's expert team.
As an Accounting Manager at River Tech for the past four years, I was responsible for the monitoring of fiscal compliance for all company departments. I also lead internal contract and expense audits, and I managed department rebuttals to noncompliance reports. I was also responsible for organizing extensive quarterly financial reports into concise overviews and presenting my findings to the executive team. My strategic recommendations were praised by the CFO as ""a vital component of the company's fiscal health.""
I am well-versed in a variety of enterprise-level software systems, including Quickbooks, NetSuite ERP, and Microsoft Dynamics. In an effort to improve internal communications, I pioneered the use of custom reporting features that improved cross-functional collaboration and reduced spending waste by more than 25%. These reports were also instrumental in successfully navigating an IRS audit in 2015.
I appreciate your time and consideration. I'm eager to learn more about the Accounting Manager position and Cloud Clearwater. With my experience leading enterprise-level accounting operations, I am confident that I will be able to provide innovative budgeting and forecasting solutions to meet Cloud Clearwater's fiscal objectives.

I even waited tables on a few occasions when we were short-staffed. After high school, I decided to study culinary arts at Longford Tech. This gave me the platform I needed to become a Restaurant Manager. I truly have a love for food, people, and learning.

The job listing indicates that you are looking for an individual to manage the daily operations of your dermatology clinic. I began my career as a general administrator at a law office and later transitioned into a position as a practice manager at a gynecology office. In both these positions, I was responsible for managing billing, inventory, employee paperwork, and marketing strategy that was critical to successful office operations.
As I managed a number of different tasks in these positions, I developed strong multi-tasking strategies, which helped me navigate an extensive and diverse workload within bustling deadline-driven work environments.

I am aware that such a position calls for a great deal of stamina. It was not unheard of at my last position for unloaders to work hours at a time without any break. Once we had to contend with flu season, and a lot of other employees were out sick. It was up to me to pick up the slack, and my boss was incredibly pleased that I took the initiative to keep the company running efficiently.

When guests arrive at the hotel, they should be treated like celebrities right from the start.
Attention to detail is also important. I implemented a system at my last job where all valet drivers would have to fill out a short form indicating whether there was any damage on a vehicle prior to us driving it. This was done to reduce the number of complaints from drivers implying we caused the damage, but with this system, we were able to circumvent all of that.

My time as a social worker and the fact that I am an officially accredited optician give me both the technical skills and ability to make people feel relaxed and comfortable.
I only recently moved here, but up until now I was a social worker for recovering alcoholics. I met with patients either twice a month or every week so that they could tell someone about whatever was troubling them. Ever since I was a little girl, I just wanted to help anyone that I could and make them feel good to be around me, so I would make sure to not only console patients but help them celebrate the victories that they didn’t give themselves enough credit for. This experience gives more than enough proof that I can work with anyone and not have them feel pestered or unwelcome.
Since I knew that I would want to try something else when I came out here, I participated in an online accredited optician program, which left me with the certification on my resume. It covered everything from a general study of optics and eye physiology to practical courses in math and business management. I know everything that I need to know to handle all the business tasks that you would require of me like maintaining sales records and prescriptions, and I have the knowledge to know how to properly fit glasses and educate customers about their eye wear and any supplemental coatings and treatments that they can get.
My specific optical knowledge and my experience working closely with people give me more than enough skills to excel in this opening. Thank you for your time, and I eagerly anticipate talking more in an interview."

1870,General Laborer Cover Letter,"unafraid, delicious, talented, willing, popular",Frida’s Bakery,"I have loved baking goods since I was a kid. I have put that passion to use at various bakeries over the years, and I believe I have acquired the skills you are looking for in a talented baker.
While I am perfectly capable of following recipes to create delicious cookies, cakes, and pies, I am also unafraid to work on my own to create unique concoctions. For example, when I worked at Frida’s Bakery, I created the “Cherry Vanilla Soufflé.” The manager loved the initiative I took and started selling it. It quickly became one of our most popular items on Yelp.
However, I also understand that being a baker entails more responsibilities than simply baking food. I am more than willing to interact with all customers and listen to their orders and any concerns they might have. Over the years, I have needed to relay information from customers to the manager, and I always make sure to write everything down to make sure nothing gets forgotten.
If there is anything else you would like to know about my background, I would be more than happy to schedule a time to discuss my skills further. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon."

I started working in food service at the Grand Hotel. Surprisingly, I found that it was perfect for me, giving me the opportunity to combine creativity with service.
Within the catering department, we rotated positions so that I was able to work in a variety of capacities such as serving, preparing platters, decorating, and even, in a pinch, simple bartending. Food service offers a great way to interact with people and provide them with something we all love-fine food and beverages.
