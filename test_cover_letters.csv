3,Adjunct Faculty Cover Letter,"sterling, diligent, mathematical, inspiring, complete","I'm honored to apply to the Adjunct Faculty position at Clearwater University. As I'm currently working on my Ph.D. in mathematical physics at Clearwater, this role will provide me with valuable experience that will ready me to become a full professor once my thesis is complete. I am not only a diligent researcher in my chosen field, but I'm also able to use that diligence to prepare lesson plans for full professors at the university and assist them by grading papers, answering students' questions during office hours and helping to teach students.
After finishing my B.S. and M.S. in mathematical physics at Clearwater, my sterling academic record earned me immediate acceptance into the Ph.D. program.

6,Admissions Counselor Cover Letter,"concerted, tough, prospective, rewarding, passionate","I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Admissions Counselor position at River Tech. I am confident that my previous experience and strong educational foundation will prove me an exceptional candidate for this position.
My previous role as an Admissions Counselor at Coral Springs University proved to be rewarding and educational for me. As an Admissions Counselor, I was responsible for providing prospective students with information and guidance about their program of interest, both in person and over the phone. I also helped enroll students throughout their college careers by answering questions, serving as a point of contact and helping them through tough times. I was also responsible for contacting inquiries that came in through various sources and making a concerted effort to reach each student on a personal level. It was most rewarding to see my students graduate after four long years, knowing that I did my best to help them complete their degree.
My work experience is complemented by my education from Hawaii Western University. There, I studied education with a minor in psychology. I enjoyed every minute of it. Because of my love for education, I decided to get my master's degree in education as well. During my college experience, I often asked my Admissions Counselor about the details of her job. She was very passionate about her work, and she became a mentor to me. I knew that I wanted to become an Admissions Counselor too.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about River Tech and the Admissions Counselor role.

7,Art Teacher Cover Letter,"Even, older, second, passionate, specific","I have two passions in life. The first is creating and nurturing art. The second is working with children to help them create as well. I cannot help but think the opportunity to become an Art Teacher at River Tech is the perfect place for me. My love of art started at a very young age. I was constantly drawing, painting, sewing, and frankly, ruining. Not all art generated by a child is going to be beneficial! But from staining a few too many surfaces at my parents' house, I grew passionate about my skills.
I took the next step by attending Longford Tech. Teaching wasn't immediately on my radar, but it soon followed. I honed my craft while simultaneously expanding my horizons. A love of art grew into a love of helping others with their art, and eventually, teaching others.
After graduation, I worked at Retail Ocean, a studio in town. Not all students were children, which actually worked to my benefit. I learned the different patterns necessary to teach students of all ages and skill levels. And just because someone is older does not mean they are more advanced in a specific technique or craft. The balance aided me greatly as I moved to working exclusively with children.
Even children have vastly different learning curves. And finding each student's learning technique is part of the fun. Seeing a young child create a piece of art after hardly knowing the first step to doing so is a joy that cannot be matched. Becoming an Art Teacher at River Tech would stoke this joy, and I would love to be considered for the position.
Sincerely,"
8,Artist Cover Letter,"pastel, colorful, expressive, biggest, favorite","I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Artist position at Cloud Clearwater. As a lifelong artist, I am confident in my ability to create expressive and interesting pieces that match the needs of your clientele. Based on my experience and education, I feel that I am well-suited for the Artist position.
Ever since I could hold a pencil, I have been creating works of art. From pencil sketches to pastel drawings to Bob Ross-inspired paintings, I did it all. At a very early age, I knew what I wanted to do with my life. In high school, I took Advanced Placement Art and won several awards. By the time I finished high school, I knew that my area of expertise was painting. The walls of my childhood home are still covered with my paintings.
During my education at Longford Tech I studied art history, design, drawing, color theory, and painting. Throughout college, my work was selected to be in many art shows, including the TradeLot Art Show, one of the biggest shows on the West Coast. My paintings featured a wide range of subjects such as mermaids, people, sailboats, beaches, monuments, plants, and much more. My favorite element to experiment with is color. I enjoy seeing how a colorful painting can add brightness to any room. The most rewarding part of being an artist is seeing the face of the client when they see their finished order.
Thank you for your time and consideration of my application. I look forward to learning about Cloud Clearwater and its clients. I feel that the Artist position will allow me to utilize my well-practiced skills to add value to your company.
Sincerely,"
9,Assistant Principal Cover Letter,"fond, English, little, much, own","I am inquiring about your opening for Assistant Principal at River Tech and would love to be considered for the position. I believe I have the necessary compassion and leadership skills to excel at such an opportunity. My experiences and skills align perfectly with what would be required of me at River Tech.
My teaching experience began as a graduate assistant at Green Valley State. There, balancing my own schoolwork with teaching, I learned to appreciate both sides of the student dynamic. Students often take teachers for granted, and teachers often expect too much or predict too little of their students. Being able to witness both sides simultaneously was a real benefit to my growth.
Upon graduating, I accepted a teaching job at Crane & Jenkins where I was able to hone my abilities in the classroom, working with a class load of nearly 120 students my first year. For the next five years, I continued this work, not only serving as an English teacher but also organizing numerous school clubs and organizations like Best Buddies and 4-H.
While working at Crane & Jenkins, I would also arrange events and meetings at the school, working as a liaison between students, faculty, and parents. Working with the teachers and the students is what I want to continue to do. I am also fond of what I have read about River Tech. The size of the student body, as well as the campus itself, feels perfect for what the staff is able to accomplish.
Sincerely,"
10,Banker Cover Letter,"qualified, advanced, vital, friendly, organized","I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Banker position at Crane & Jenkins. As an organized and professional lover of mathematics, I am confident that I can succeed as a Banker. While I am calculated and technical, I am also friendly and have the communication skills vital to the job of a Banker. I believe that my experience and education prove me well-qualified for the Banker position.
At Northwest Vermont University, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Finance. I studied statistics, accounting, economics, portfolio management, business, and many other important topics. I am well-versed in finance, banking, and accounting. I interned at a bank for my capstone and learned a lot about the banking processes and procedures. During my childhood schooling, I excelled in my math courses. In high school, I was in the math club and took every advanced math course that my school had to offer.
During my previous role as Banker at River Tech, I was responsible for providing account services such as depositing checks, taking check orders, keeping detailed records of transactions, and opening and closing accounts. I prioritized paying attention to detail, providing excellent customer service, and staying up to date on all bank policies and procedures.
Thank you for taking this time to review me as a candidate for the Banker position at Crane & Jenkins. I look forward to learning more about the company and the expectations of the Banker position.

11,Barista Cover Letter,"extroverted, clogged, vibrant, fantastic, outgoing","I am not just another young adult looking for a job at a coffee shop. I live and breathe coffee, and I absolutely adore Cloud Clearwater. I am excited to apply for the Barista opening at Cloud Clearwater because I am passionate about foam, caffeine, and smiling, and I love the inviting atmosphere.
At my last position as Barista for the coffee shop at Retail Ocean, I perfected our signature coffee swirl in a record two weeks. In 14 days, I learned to not only make the lattes themselves but also craft an absolutely perfect Retail Ocean wave atop the steaming cup, and I know that I could quickly learn to craft any foam creation for this new position. Beyond that, I would love to branch out from my coffee interests to pastries, teas, and the other menu items offered at Cloud Clearwater.
I am outgoing, extroverted, and would easily blend with the already vibrant staff employed with Cloud Clearwater. I work extremely well under pressure, and I am able to grin on cue despite the morning and evening rushes that might stress some people out. In addition to all of these skills, I also have a fantastic memory and have been known to memorize drink orders to faces, therefore speeding up clogged lines. Along with these behind-the-counter talents, I am also dedicated to the tasks that aren't coffee related too. Stocking can be fun, and I would love to join the team to be the Barista you need when you need it!
Thank you so much for your consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon. I can be reached at either sflores@email.com or (123) 456-7891.

12,Bookkeeper Cover Letter,"lifelong, extra, primary, unparalleled, bottom","I'm delighted by the opportunity to apply for the Bookkeeper position at Cloud Clearwater. I have worked at various jobs over my career, but bookkeeping has always been one of my primary skills. I understand the importance of keeping a detailed record of financials; it can be the difference between a business experiencing long-term success or failure. I believe I have the perfect skill set for this job, and I'm excited to learn more about this position.
During my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I was Head Bookkeeper for over five years and kept an overview of all financial records. During my tenure there, Crane & Jenkins experienced unparalleled success that resulted in an 18% increase in revenue over those five years. I also worked closely with other administrators, and I excelled in the team-oriented environment.
Besides work experience in the accounting field, I have a master's degree in finance and graduated with honors. I have always been skilled with numbers, and my educational courses have prepared me for a lifelong career in the bookkeeping field. Paying attention to the small details is one of my keys to success in bookkeeping, and it has allowed me to help companies reduce expenses and improve their bottom lines.

13,Brand Manager Cover Letter,"intelligent, permanent, proud, delighted, greater","I'm excited to have the good fortune to be applying for the Brand Manager position at Innovation Advertising. I love the field of marketing, so I have a real passion for developing a relationship with clients in order to understand their branding needs. I am also delighted to be able to apply for a position at a company that is known for its top-notch marketing standards, having won the award for Branding Company of the Year for the past seven years in the areas of customer satisfaction as well as innovation in marketing creativity.
I possess a bachelor's degree in brand management from Clearwater University, and I was chosen for a high-profile internship at Crossover Marketing, where I took on a permanent position. During this tenure, I have gained three years' experience at leading, building and managing brands for over 200 clients. This includes managing various internal teams to produce intelligent and creative branding solutions that reflect the personality of clients as well as their products.
My experience shows that I can identify the image that each client visualizes for its brand, and I can be responsible for the creative direction of the concept from start to finish, delivering a marketing product that will serve the client in both a digital and a physical environment. I am particularly proud of the feedback from clients through testimonials because of the branding satisfaction they have experienced in working with myself and my team of professionals.

Sincerely,"
14,Buyer Cover Letter,"sad, false, rude, cheerful, acceptable","I am very interested in your position of Buyer for the gift shop at Centurion Medical. I have owned a home decorating company for two years and am familiar with dropshipping as well as buying from wholesalers. I feel like part of the job is helping people find a little something to take their minds off of possibly a very sad time, and I can do that.
I had some false starts before I started my own business. I learned that what I thought were fails really taught me valuable lessons in the world of business. I learned how to work with suppliers by having to deal with some rude people. But I also met some very helpful ones who guided me and who made me better. I just wanted to make people happy with items in my store that would make their homes more cheerful and comfortable.
I usually work alone, but some things require that I get out in the world. Things like research in finding what people like are something that is done in both going into stores as well as sitting on the sofa looking online. Something I have learned by researching is that by talking to people a little bit, I can get an idea of what might make them (or the person they're shopping for) smile. If someone can leave the gift shop with a smile on his or her face, that's a good thing.
As a Buyer, I would spend time in the store as well as just ordering inventory. If that would be acceptable to you, I would be very open to working out a schedule that would put me actually in the gift shop a few hours a week. Thank you for your time in considering my application.
Sincerely,"
15,Caregiver Cover Letter,"geriatric, teenage, frail, empathetic, light","I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Caregiver position at Crane & Jenkins. As a highly empathetic and caring individual with extensive experience in the caregiving field, I am confident that I can succeed as a Caregiver at Crane & Jenkins, a trusted name in geriatric care since 1990.
During my tenure at River Tech, I provided home health care for a rotation of 10 patients per week, five days a week. My responsibilities included light housework, giving baths, preparing small snacks, reading to patients, helping them around the house, helping patients use the restroom, providing companionship, keeping track of appointments, and feeding patients. I am very passionate about the well-being of my patients. I believe that the elderly are a valuable and important generation, full of wisdom and knowledge and that they need to be cared for and protected.
During my teenage years, I served as a primary caregiver for my grandmother. As a frail woman in her late 90s, she needed a lot of assistance with most day-to-day functions. Since I was there more than my parents, who both worked full-time, I took it upon myself to be her caregiver. The more time I spent with her, the more I realized that although her body may not function, her mind was an ocean of stories and wisdom, waiting to be explored. I will always cherish the time I had with her and the things she taught me.
I would like to thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about Crane & Jenkins and the expectations of the Caregiver role.

I believe my years of experience as a cashier and passion for healthy living will prove me a great candidate as a cashier at Retail Ocean. I admire the company's commitment to providing consumers with healthful, whole products that will increase their quality and length of life.
As a young candidate, I have high energy and an eagerness to learn. During my tenure at my local farmers' market, I worked for hours on my feet while attending high school full-time, keeping up with my grades, and being involved in several sports. I enjoyed working with the fresh produce and doing a job where I could be active.
I am currently attending Coral Springs University and studying chiropractic care with a minor in alternative medicine. I am a firm believer in the healing power of a whole-food, organic, and plant-based diet. My parents taught me the value of health and always said that ""health is wealth."" I come from a very active, hardworking family. My father is a personal trainer and my mother is a florist. My upbringing lit a fire inside of me to be successful and to be healthy. I strongly believe that a healthy body is more efficient and can produce better results at school, on the field, and at work.
Thank you for reviewing my application for the Cashier position at Retail Ocean. I am confident that my high energy, optimal health, and background with plant-based and whole foods will make me a valuable team player at your company. I look forward to learning more about Retail Ocean.

17,CEO Cover Letter,"assertive, typical, sufficient, intimate, attractive","I'm genuinely excited to be applying for the position of CEO at Centurion Medical. You'll find in me a driven, assertive executive devoted to achieving success. I demand the very best from myself in all things that I do. This allows me to demand the same from my staff. Confidence and belief in oneself are extremely important qualities in a leader, and I believe that I possess them in sufficient quantity to be an excellent CEO for your organization. Of course, I also have a strong and ever-present sense of personal responsibility that extends not only to the shareholders of any business entrusted to me but also to its employees and customers. The prospect of leading this superb company into a new future offers an irresistibly attractive challenge.
I am different from the typical prospective CEO in a way that makes me especially well-suited to run a company like Centurion Medical: I have a medical degree. I earned my M.D. from Clearwater University, so I have an intimate knowledge of the ins and outs of medicine and medical technology. This would make me uniquely sensitive to the needs and concerns of the staff at Centurion Medical.
After earning my medical degree, I decided to become an entrepreneur. I've started several companies of my own and sold them for a substantial profit. This led to an offer to head one of the largest medical corporations west of the Mississippi River. When I assumed control, it had been in the red for the past consecutive five years. After one year of my leadership, we turned a profit of 28%, and that increased by at least 12% annually until I resigned three years later.
My experience has taught me that a CEO should be far more than merely the boss. Every successful company is actually a collection of committed and talented individuals who are fulfilled by their work and inspired by their leadership. If were granted the honor of leading Centurion Medical, I would be working for you as much as you would be working for me, and I'd do everything in my power to earn that admiration while serving as your CEO.
Sincerely,"
18,Chef Cover Letter,"intriguing, true, hard, original, aware","A young Chef always dreams of creating their own menu. When I became aware of the opening at Cloud Clearwater, I knew it was the right opportunity for me to pursue. It would be a dream come true to even be seriously considered for this position of Chef. It would mean all my hard work was paying off.
I spent some time early in my life at Longford Tech. Though I didn't complete my full degree, it was five semesters well spent. My time at school helped me learn and focus on what I really wanted to do with my life: cook. Throughout school, besides attending business classes, I grew my hobby into my passion.
Instead of staying for my full degree at Longford Tech, I moved to a great opportunity when the time was right. The chance to work and create in a kitchen at a real restaurant was too intriguing to pass up. Though I wasn't creating the menu by any means, my position at TradeLot allowed me to do the next best thing. It prepared me for the work and desire it takes to create and run a menu, and I learned that the best dishes often come from tweaks to original plans.
If given the opportunity to create my own menu at Cloud Clearwater, I know I will not waste it. This is the chance I have been waiting for since leaving school early and seeking out my passion of cooking. Even before getting started, I know every test meal will not be a hit. However, I can promise that every piece of food that makes it to the customers will be my best effort.
Sincerely,"
19,Civil Engineer Cover Letter,"straightforward, relaxed, foreseeable, safer, attentive","I was very excited to see your posting for the Civil Engineer position at River Tech. I have been working in the engineering field for several years, and during that time I have been a part of multiple projects, including ones that focused on the maintenance of several roads and the design of Cloud Clearwater Bridge. I am particularly detail oriented, and I have always been praised for my ability to foresee potential problems and make proactive plans.
In my previous role as Civil Engineer, I was responsible for examining the stability of the bridge that we were building and assessing how it would withstand an earthquake. I also helped with the maintenance and upgrading of several roads that needed drainage to make the roads safer for travel and improve the longevity of the road's surface.
I am not only attentive to detail when designing and maintaining roads and bridges. I am also attentive to the criticism of others, and I highly value feedback that will make my projects run more smoothly. I appreciate straightforward yet relaxed professional interactions, and I aim for that dynamic with all of my colleagues and outside contacts.
I sincerely look forward to further discussing the role of Civil Engineer at River Tech. I'm also excited to hear more about some of the projects that River Tech has been involved in as well as any projects in the foreseeable future. I appreciate your time in considering me for this position.

20,CMA Cover Letter,"actuarial, likely, varied, impressive, vast","I am excited to apply for the available CMA position at Foundry Marketing. I recognize that a large company like Foundry engages in an extraordinarily complex set of financial transactions every day, holds varied assets of all over the world and must file an intricate tax return each year. Properly recording all of this information, assessing the value of Foundry's assets and predicting its likely future financial performance requires a skilled and meticulous hand. I pride myself on the care and precision with which I always approach my work, and I have the ability to synthesize vast quantities of information. I believe that these traits and skills make me a natural fit for this role.
By passing the extremely rigorous certification exam and becoming a CMA, I have demonstrated a deep knowledge of accounting and actuarial principles, financial reporting, business analysis and strategic business management. As such, I not only have a strong understanding of the technical accounting end of the responsibilities involved in this position but am a capable manager as well. My managerial expertise is further bolstered by the fact that I have started and run a number of companies of my own — hiring personnel, managing accounts, preparing and submitting financial records, filing taxes and seeking ways to improve company performance.
I have been employed in a number of managerial roles at other companies throughout my career as well. In particular, I served as CFO of a small investment advisory firm called Centurion Financial Group. This role required me not only to meticulously examine and prepare financial data but also oversee the operations and performance of numerous investment advisers and stockbrokers as they invested clients' money. At that time, I presided over an average annual growth rate of investor portfolios of 19%.
Thank you very much for your time and attention in considering me for this crucial position. I truly believe that with me at the helm of its financial records, Foundry Marketing can perform exceptionally well in the years ahead. It would be my privilege to assume the responsibilities of a CMA at Foundry. As we move ahead in the hiring process, I humbly hope that I may be accepted into ranks of this impressive firm.

I am a highly skilled stylist who pays a lot of attention to detail so that I can achieve picture-perfect hairstyles. Crane & Jenkins Hair Salon is a leader in the cosmetology industry, and I would be honored to contribute my expertise to a hair salon that has such a stellar reputation.
During my employment at Cloud Clearwater Hair Studios, I was Lead Stylist and worked hard to promote a positive image throughout the hair studios. While working at Cloud Clearwater Hair Studios, I helped to increase the client database by 32% within a 12-month span. I was sure to always be a shining example of a dedicated, professional stylist in order to boost the company's image and the styling team's morale.
I received my cosmetology degree from Longford Technical Career School in 2004. I graduated at the top of my class, and I gave back to my community by volunteering to style the hair of women and children at the local women's shelter. As my experience grew, so did my list of clients. During my previous employment, I styled the hair of many prominent figures, including Sofia Flores, a popular A-list actress, and Ivy Haddington, a famous public speaker.
I appreciate your time and consideration of my application. I am eager to put my passion and skills to use with Crane & Jenkins Hair Salon, and I look forward to telling you more about what I have to offer.

23,Credit Analyst Cover Letter,"dominant, verifiable, multinational, underserved, favorable","I am delighted to submit my application for the Credit Analyst position that became available at Flagship Engineering. As a professional who has spent multiple years in the lending departments of multinational companies, I have built an incredibly versatile set of skills that will suit this role well. I am eager to work for Flagship Engineering, which is one of the most dominant companies in the civil engineering industry, where I hope to help buyers reach favorable financing terms and engage in a smooth transaction process.
During my previous Credit Analyst role with Centurion Medical, I was in charge of cross-referencing customers' credit histories with verifiable sources of income to determine purchasing eligibility. I also helped set up contracts that took those customers' financial standing into account while I prioritized the company's safety and profitability.
I constantly seek new ways to help businesses improve their operations by reaching into the untapped markets. By exploring demand from underserved customers, I was able to increase the number of signed contracts for my prior employer by 39%. This also led to a record-breaking PR campaign that helped the business attain the status of a community support leader. I aspire to utilize these skills to help Flagship Engineering serve more clients and increase the number of contracts signed by facilitating excellent and forward-thinking credit analyses.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I am very happy to continue the application process by discussing all of my accomplishments in more detail.

I am a pioneer of the innovative service business where I polished my skills by working as the Customer Representative, Manager and Director. My technical abilities allowed me to lead successful outreach campaigns and involve the community in the efforts of my former employees.
While working in my previous role at Innovation Advertising, I managed the customer feedback line and led the company's training on conflict resolution.

I perpetually leveraged professional communication, leadership and organizational skills to develop employees, which improved their upward mobility, whilst attending to customers' unique needs.
One of my greatest strengths pertains to diagnosing problems. I am able to pinpoint areas of concern and identify their underlying causes. While working at Innovation Advertising, this particular talent allowed me to detect seven different malfunctions of the information systems that could have led to over 400 dissatisfied buyers. By overseeing the urgent response group, I was able to contain the problem and avoid negative consequences. I believe that my understanding of customer service procedures across all industries would make me a great fit for Foundry Marketing.
Thank you for considering my application. I appreciate your time and look forward to future correspondence that would allow me to gain further insight into your expectations. I would also enjoy a chance to communicate with you in-person and overview some of my growth objectives that this role would allow me to achieve.

I am thrilled at the prospect of bringing my technical expertise and interpersonal skills to Cloud Clearwater's thriving practice.
During my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I was given the opportunity to serve in a number of roles to help grow the company. In addition to providing excellent service to our patients, I was responsible for managing daily office administration tasks, including record management, insurance, billing, and supply inventory. In an effort to improve efficiency, I redesigned our inventory ordering and tracking system, which reduced duplicate ordering and resulted in a 10% overall cost reduction.

I would love the opportunity to offer my talents to Crane & Jenkins, a leading dental provider in the area.
During my previous employment at River Tech, I acted as the Dental Hygienist for two dentists, educated patients regarding their oral health, and helped select software to streamline the appointment booking process. When a new system was implemented to book appointments, I went above and beyond by obtaining the manufacturer's certification, which allowed me to train dental assistants and other hygienists on the system. The new system increased the number of appointments by 40%.
I am attentive to the needs of my patients and strive to create a relaxing environment and to ensure their comfort during cleanings. As a consummate professional, I enjoy challenging cases. For instance, many of my patients at River Tech had advanced gingivitis, so I became extremely vigilant to any signs of pain or distress. To ensure a high level of cleanliness, I also meticulously cleaned my instruments and the equipment and fixtures in the treatment rooms.

36,Event Coordinator Cover Letter,"enough, entire, perfect, real, many","I was informed of your opening for Event Coordinator at TradeLot and knew I must apply. This position lines up perfectly with my skills, experiences, and goals for the future. I previously attended Hawaii Western, earning my degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management. By working through real-world examples, we learned the ins and outs of many customer-focused businesses. Side work also gave me a solid background in finance and honed my organizational skills.
It wasn't enough to learn about customer service, though. I had to experience that for myself. After graduating, I became a Facilities and Events Assistant at Coral Springs University. There, I gained the entire blueprint of what an Event Coordinator is all about.
Coordinating an event is about more than renting out a space. A room must be prepped. It must be organized and set up to the specifications of the client. Events must be monitored throughout. And when the event wraps, a coordinator's job is not done. There is follow-up that must be adhered to. Though CSU was not hosting events as a for-profit enterprise, our department still worked through each step of the process.
From CSU, I moved onto Cloud Clearwater Inn. This gave me personal knowledge of what happens when we are using it as a profit generator. It was yet another side of being an Event Coordinator. My hope to appease the client and do my best to adhere to their desires is what will make me a perfect fit at TradeLot.

I began my career as a software developer, so I understand the needs, culture and work environment of software firms like Crossover. However, I was able to carry over the same kind of problem-solving acuity that served me so well in the development field into a managerial role. I believe that my intimate familiarity with the software world combined with my communication skills, charisma and organizational abilities make me an excellent fit for this position.
I've always had a knack for numbers and solving problems. The more difficult the problem, the more driven I am to solve it. It seems natural that such inclinations would have led me to initially become a software developer. Working at Flagship Network Technologies gave free reign to my penchant for systematic thinking that is vital to a leadership role.
As my career progressed, I began to be put into more senior roles, eventually leading and coordinating teams of software developers on large-scale projects. Such work gave me my first taste of what it was to be a manager, and I found that I enjoyed it. I had the interpersonal communication skills necessary to inspire trust and the kind of vision and leadership qualities that earned me respect from those working beneath me. Under my direction, my development team was able to roll out new code more quickly, performing all necessary debugging and maintenance operations, and we were ultimately able to submit work to clients 20% faster than before.
I thank you for your time in examining me for this role. With one foot in the development world and the other foot in the management world, I believe that I have the unique combination of talents and experiences that make for an excellent executive at Crossover. It would be an honor to join the Crossover team and help push your wonderful company to new heights.

I am looking forward to using my skills as an Exercise Physiologist at Crossover Health Services—a company that not only has charitable branches worldwide but also one that provides preventative and rehabilitative health care free to those in need.
During my previous tenure at Centurion Medical, I developed my skills in performing patient care intervention, assessing patient conditions for proper test referral and administering medication while educating patients and their families about treatment.
I am very aware of how important positive customer interaction can be in developing a relationship with not only the patient but also the family members to develop trust. This also includes an understanding of various patient populations and their diverse needs. A large part of my role is training patients to eventually perform the prescribed exercises on their own. I take pride in being recognized as a stand-out Exercise Physiologist in this area, having received numerous letters of recognition for my work in training others to be better patient educators. My superiors and patients have attested to my passion for the job, and my passion is something I can contribute to your patients on a daily basis.

39,Field Technician Cover Letter,"prevalent, harder, safer, nervous, main","In my search for meaningful employment in health care, I have investigated areas that allow me some degree of flexibility. I believe that your position of Field Technician at Centurion Medical offers just that. My previous work as a Field Technician has taught me many things not only in health care but in dealing with IT issues and working with all kinds of people.
My experience as a Field Technician was with Flagiship Enterprises, a company that retrieved patient medical records for the purpose of insurance company auditing. My job was to travel throughout my state, going to medical offices and hospitals to retrieve the requested records via flash drive and upload them to the company at the end of the day. My efficiency scores in past two years were at 94% and 97%.
There are still some doctors who use paper charts. In those cases, I would copy the needed information and then scan and upload it to my office. As a Field Technician, I used different software programs that are made especially for EMRs. With medical fraud becoming so prevalent, programs are getting harder to crack, which means they're safer for patient information. Staff would often get nervous about me being in their files, but I was able to reassure them that I was there to help prevent fraud.
As a field technician for Centurion Medical, not only would I bring knowledge with me, but I would enjoy learning the ways your company teaches its Field Technicians in order to do the job your way. My main goal would be to do my job as quickly and efficiently as I could while helping the staff feel at ease. Thank you for your time and consideration.

I enjoy helping the students, and I love learning new techniques for managing records and files in an efficient manner. I am highly motivated and committed to using my abilities to assist others.
During my employment with Turner State College, I worked in the Office of Student Admissions. While there, I collected student data and prioritized their files for subsequent entry into our data repositories by our Data Entry Specialist.

I was rated as Employee of the Month for our office five times during the course of three years. I am competent with time management, and I thrive in a fast-paced environment.
Besides handling many filing duties, I also handled communications from the students who frequented the Office of Student Admissions. This office serves as the front portal for many of our incoming students and also for interested students and their parents. I worked in the front portion of the office, and I helped the office staff by correctly prioritizing and routing the students to the correct avenues for their concerns. I am able to communicate clearly and professionally with all types of people.

As a detail-oriented analyst with a passion for numbers, I am thrilled at the chance to develop successful strategic financial models based on my data-driven insights and wealth of industry expertise.
With more than seven years as a Financial Analyst at River Tech, I held the responsibility of analyzing and refining intricate FP&A models for privately held, multimillion-dollar global organizations. I developed a series of recurring reports that enhanced our forecasting and budgeting processes.

During my decade of experience in the financial industry, I've developed a talent for distilling complex financial data into clear, concise and actionable reports that support executive decision-making. Senior leadership commended me at River Tech for my ability to think strategically and anticipate future industry trends and company needs. In late 2009, I developed a model that highlighted several market red flags; that awareness prevented the company from executing a merger that would have failed during the 2011 ""Black Monday"" market crash.

Rather than dreaming it so, I made it so and would love to continue the course of my career with the Crane & Jenkins company. I read about your opening for a new Firefighter and would be elated to join up. I feel strongly that my skills and experience would be a perfect match.
My dream of becoming a Firefighter didn't materialize out of nowhere. I actually began my service life as a Police Officer, albeit briefly. I attended police academy at Green Valley State, eventually passing and joining the force in town. The job wasn't what I was best at, though. Instead, firefighting was where my heart was. From the academy, I spent time as a volunteer fireman.
There are similarities between the careers. Both highlight my desire to serve and protect my community. Both require physical, mental, and emotional strength. These are all key aspects of my personality. I perform well under pressure and seem to rise to the occasion when there is a life to be saved.
Combining my desire into a career is the outcome for which I was destined. Obtaining this position would be a dream, but it would also just be the start.

I believe that these qualities, combined with my commitment to always doing the best work that I possibly can, make me an ideal candidate for the position.
As a General Manager at Centurion Medical Research, I was expected to not only coordinate the many research departments and personnel working there but also to meet regularly with potential investors and persuade them to give their give their money to the enterprise. Furthermore, I held regular meetings with financial managers in which I oversaw the financial operations of the company and then made suggestions and implemented plans to improve its growth prospects. As a result of my input, I was able to cut costs and improve quarterly profits by 11%.
I also served as General Manager at Crossover Software. A major part of this role involved having to meet with potential investors and venture capitalists, giving lively and informative presentations in which I explained to them why they should invest in Crossover. Additionally, it was my responsibility to vet and interview potential new employees. Thus, I have significant experience in balancing many different managerial responsibilities at once.
I thank you very much for your time and consideration. I am confident that, as we move forward through the hiring process, I will be able to fulfill the responsibilities of the General Manager position at Foundry Marketing.

45,Graduate Assistant Cover Letter,"closer, tight, athletic, thrilled, major","I am applying for the Graduate Assistant position at Crane & Jenkins University. As a Sports Studies graduate student at the university, I am eager to start a position to supplement my studies. I have knowledge of ice hockey, field hockey, badminton and gymnastics, which are all sports the university offers. Furthermore, I am creative, fast-thinking and innovative and great at analyzing game footage. I am thrilled about the idea of helping out the department, the student-athletes and the fans.
At Coral Springs University, I served as the Marketing Intern for the Department of Athletics, specifically for men's ice hockey and the women's gymnastics teams. I put together game-day rosters, play-by-play videos and media guides. I also shot practice footage, interviewed student-athletes and managed game-day promotions. I assisted in creating a positive environment for fans, athletes and staff members.
The Crane & Jenkins Cranes can always use more fans at their games. Through my internship, I've gained experience with creating eye-catching marketing materials that have been proven to increase game attendance. I thrive on the nerves of game days and tight deadlines. With a goal to increase student attendance at the major hockey game of the season, I spearheaded an on-campus ticket giveaway, and 80% more students claimed their tickets than in years past.
Attached is my resume for your review. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to learning more about the Graduate Assistant position at Crane & Jenkins University. I believe that I would be an excellent match for the role and the position aligns with my skills and interests. Getting experience in your athletic department would help me get closer to my goal of being the Marketing Director of a team.

I understand you're currently adding several new product lines, and I believe my skills provide a significant advantage for creating a successful launch. As someone who is a longtime fan of your products, I'm thrilled at the opportunity to bring my unique style and passion for beachwear to the company.
During my previous role at Retail Ocean, I was responsible for all aspects of designing a new technology product, from package design to marketing collateral. This role provided significant insight into the full product lifecycle, which allowed me to deliver more effective and impactful designs. As a result, product sales exceeded company expectations by 20%, and we earned a 2016 American Package Design Award.
In addition to product design work, I have also expanded my portfolio to include video and animation, which are quickly becoming essential to digital marketing campaigns. I've developed a popular YouTube series on creating videos for social media, which showcases both my design skills and my passion for continuing my own education. This series has helped me stay on top of the latest marketing trends and discover innovative ways to develop eye-catching visuals.

47,Heavy Equipment Operator Cover Letter,"apparent, manual, heavy, competent, formal","It's a great sensation in seeing myself as a part of Centurion Construction. I understand that you need a competent Heavy Equipment Operator. My most valuable skills as a Heavy Equipment Operator were obtained with on-the-job experience. I also learned through formal classes and with diverse construction plans from my job sites. In addition, I have the credentials to drive excavators, loaders and skids. I look forward to discovering how my skills can be put to use on my next project. I hope that you can consider what I have to offer as you build your team and achieve the specs in your blueprints.
I began my career as a laborer by first obtaining a construction technology degree from Westwood University. I then obtained a position at Innovation Development to nurture my skills through real-world applications and make my impact as a manual laborer. During my time there I was faced with heavy materials, large construction zones and the need to carefully organize projects from beginning to end.
It became apparent that hand and foot coordination is as important as breathing. Keeping my eyes opened and focused allowed me to maintain control of every vehicle. I learned how important it is to communicate while driving. The start of my work is only possible once I complete a site inspection. I ensure that every machine is in working order. You can rely on my equipment maintenance to keep all the joints, tracks and panels in their top conditions.
The ideal conditions aren't always possible, however. But by being able to adjust to the environment, I developed my skills as a workman--which is something that could take years to develop. Thank you for this line of communication within my letter. Please share with me the things that I can expect as your Heavy Equipment Operator.

48,Home Health Aide Cover Letter,"paternal, cerebral, very, empathetic, old","I was thrilled to discover that Centurion Medical is now offering home health. I have worked as a Home Health Aide for the past six years for an independent employer, but I would love to transfer my skills to your corporation. My grandmother was hospitalized at Centurion Hospital, and she received excellent care there. I would be proud to be a staff member of this award-winning facility.
My first experience caring for the elderly came about when I was only 10 years old. My paternal grandfather had a stroke and lived with my family for three years. It was my job to help Grandpa eat. I loved having those moments with him, and it was then that I knew I wanted to help people as a career someday. A few years later, my mother gave birth to a daughter with cerebral palsy. I was involved with her care from the very beginning.
I still desire to someday become a nurse to help people even more. Right now, I am taking night classes while working to become a Home Health Aide. For three years, I have worked a variety of shifts while caring for both the elderly and the mentally and physically disabled. I have a gift for treating these patients with compassionate care. I believe it's important that we never forget the humanity that we all share.
Thank you for reviewing my application. My empathetic nature, as well as my years of experience, makes me a perfect fit for this job. I can handle everything from bedpans to feeding tubes with no oversight. I am committed to helping patients mentally, physically and emotionally. I'm excited to visit with you about the types of patients you have who require home health.

I started working in the hotel industry more than 20 years ago as a guest services representative for Centurion, a boutique hotel and spa. While working there, I received several promotions. For the past 10 years, I have worked as a Hotel Manager.
I have the managerial and leadership skills needed to be successful as your next Hotel Manager. I remain calm under pressure, have strong problem-solving abilities and possess the communication skills needed to work with different types of personalities. I understand the pressure that comes from being a Hotel Manager, so I thrive in this type of environment. I use these traits to handle escalations from guests and staff grievances when they arise and resolve all problems in a satisfactory manner. My performance reviews always note that I excel in this area. I also oversee ways to increase revenue and customer satisfaction. I have spearheaded many promotional campaigns, which increased bookings by 45%.
Additionally, I speak multiple foreign languages, which allow me to communicate with more patrons and recruit additional staff members. I am fluent in French, Spanish and Mandarin.

50,Human Resources Coordinator Cover Letter,"Upper, unable, limited, learning, helpful","I am interested in the Human Resources Coordinator position for Cloud Clearwater and the opportunity it provides to design e-learning resources for employee training and development. In my current role, my primary duties include guiding employees through the benefits sign-up process and ensuring that they follow through with evaluating and making changes to insurance benefits during the open enrollment period. Recently, I developed five e-learning modules that employees can access online to review their benefit options during the open enrollment period.
The modules have been very helpful because employees can now review benefits carefully before they make decisions about changes or additions. Employees and family members can access the modules anytime. Prior to my developing this online presentation, employees were required to attend face-to-face benefits updates during the workday, prior to beginning work, or after hours.
Upper management and my Human Resources Manager have been supportive and recognize that using technology is an efficient way to reach employees with important information. However, with limited staff, the company is unable to create a position specifically for this task. In fact, when I developed the modules, I did most of the work after hours during personal time.
Based on what I know about your company, my ability to develop high-quality e-learning resources would be an asset. I have worked for five years in my current position, so I bring knowledge of many areas related to human resources, including interviewing, coordinating benefits, orienting new employees and writing articles for the company newsletter. I look forward to the opportunity to meet you and to discuss how I can design e-learning resources that will benefit the employees at Cloud Clearwater.

51,Human Resources Generalist Cover Letter,"flexible, primary, knowledgeable, human, global","I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Human Resources Generalist position at River Tech. As an experienced HR Generalist, I understand the importance of providing great customer service and accurate information to the employees of a company.
At my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I was responsible for providing employees with information about their benefits. I am knowledgeable about health spending accounts, flexible spending accounts, Cobra, and health insurance policies. I was also responsible for analyzing data, clarifying issues between managers and employees, complying with EEO policies, and keeping a seal of confidentiality. I prided myself in providing excellent customer service to managers and employees. I became efficient at prioritizing tasks and knowing when to escalate issues.
I studied Human Resources Management at Coral Springs University. Throughout my education, I learned about topics such as labor relations, management, organizational culture, employment laws, and global human resources management. I feel strongly that my education provided me with the knowledge necessary to succeed as a Human Resources Generalist. I have a desire to help others succeed, and I see that as a primary goal of human resources. It brings me joy to help employees resolve issues quickly so that they can move forward in their job and be able to provide for their family.
Thank you for the consideration of my application. I look forward to learning more about River Tech and its employees.

52,Human Resources Manager Cover Letter,"equal, talented, human, responsible, internal","I'm excited to be applying for the Human Resources Manager position at Crane & Jenkins. As a certified human resources professional, I gain satisfaction from serving my community by helping service-oriented companies like Crane & Jenkins acquire and retain talented employees. I look forward to assisting Crane & Jenkins in the improvement of employee relations by developing and implementing initiatives that support the employees from the moment of hire until the time of retirement.
As the Director of Human Resources at Wes Morgan Philips, I was a key senior leader in the organization and was responsible for improving the efficiency and performance of the company's 540 employees. Before that, I worked in human resources, equal employment opportunity and diversity for Jenkins Technology Solutions, Inc. At Jenkins Technology Solutions Inc., I developed an employee retention plan that involved the creation of a wellness program, an internal training program and a promotions selection process, which led to a 50% reduction in the overall employee turnover rate.
Ten years of experience in human resources management and organizational development has provided me with the experience, skills and ability required to lead the human resource management team and help recruit and retain talented staff to make Crane & Jenkins one of the best places to work. I have a Bachelor's degree in Human Resources and Labor Relations from Coral Springs University and a Master's degree in Organizational Development and Strategic Human Resources from Northwest Vermont University.

53,Intelligence Analyst Cover Letter,"proudest, precious, greatest, distinguished, tremendous","It is a tremendous honor for me to be able to apply to become an Intelligence Analyst at Centurion Security. Investigating and examining intelligence and training operatives to assist and serve the US government, as private contractors like Centurion do, is one of the greatest privileges. With my extremely data-oriented mentality, strong analytical skills and personal integrity, I believe that I can be an asset to both Centurion and the intelligence community it regularly works with. In my opinion, my most precious skills are my perceptiveness and ability to read body language and detect deception — a crucial skill for all of those looking to recruit additional agents — train them and assign them to duties applicable to their talents.
I have extensive experience in the fields of security, law enforcement and data analysis. I worked as a private investigator for Flagship Security, familiarizing myself with open-source intelligence-gathering techniques and interviewing potential suspects in the course of my work. Later, I became a police officer and enjoyed a distinguished 10-year career before deciding to apply the knowledge and experience I gained in the intelligence-gathering sector towards becoming an Intelligence Analyst for Crossover Security Solutions.
While at Crossover, I picked up valuable computer programming and quantitative data analysis skills that improved the efficiency at which I could gather, collate and sift through open-source intelligence. My work providing and analyzing potentially valuable intelligence for the Department of Defense and the CIA has been among the proudest of my life.
I thank you graciously for your time, kindness and attention for considering me for this all-important position. It is an honor to be able to use my intelligence, experience and facility with quantitative data to serve my country through the private sector. As we move through the hiring process, I am prepared to demonstrate the full extent of my talents and to allow them to be used wherever I can be of most value.

I am dedicated and passionate about all aspects of computers and am confident in my ability to be an asset to the team. As someone who is always excited to learn and develop my skills through practical applications, I look forward to the opportunity to improve both myself and the company with my talents as an employee.
At my former place of employment, I was frequently commended for my attention to detail and ability to manage several departments worth of employees all on short notice. Additionally, performance reviews consistently recognized me as being within the top 5% in regard to problem resolution success rates.
I was selected to be the leader on a development project that created a corporate audit tracking system still used by the company today. This system saved the company close to $100,000 in its first year of use and has only returned better results each year. My team also managed to complete this project with only a little under a week prior to the deadline thanks in part to my excellent time management and motivational abilities.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I am eager to learn more about the IT Manager position you have available and am happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have at your convenience. Crossover Software is one of the leaders in IT with a track record for fostering growth in both the industry and its employees. This is something I am excited about seeing firsthand. Computers and information technology are my passion, and I can only hope that you see fit to allow me to share my knowledge and experience with the company.

I have have loved tinkering with computers since childhood and have had an intense desire to pick them apart and learn how they work from the start. This early fascination grew in me over the years and I acquired a strong set of problem-solving skills. I think that with my analytical acumen, I can bring something of value to your company.
I have previous experience working as a software developer for Flagship Computer Engineering. In this role, I not only wrote intricate software, but I also interacted regularly with customers to help them resolve their issues with software products. In addition to this, I have earned A+ and Network+ Certifications from CompTIA, which have given me significant hands-on experience setting up Wi-Fi networks, configuring them, working with routers, adding and removing additional devices to private networks and debugging a wide range of software and hardware issues in the IT world.
Moreover, I am familiar with a broad assortment of malware types and how to remove them or present them from infecting a system. Using what I know, I have been able to work with customers both remotely and in-person to resolve their computer-related difficulties. I thus am just as experienced with the technical end of IT as I am with the customer service end.
I am grateful for your time, kindness and attention in considering me for this position. Working as an IT Specialist at Crossover Software would not only allow me an outlet for what I think are my natural analytical abilities, but it would also allow me to do something I love while providing service and assistance to others. It would be an honor to be able to work as part of the team of excellent IT Specialists and Technicians that you have at Crossover.

As a dedicated and highly skilled legal professional, I have a passion for combining meticulous research and creative problem-solving to produce successful legal outcomes for clients. I have served a wide variety of corporate and nonprofit organizations, and I am thrilled at the opportunity to make a positive impact in the community at River Tech, a leader in legal services for 501(c)(3) organizations.
During my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I had the opportunity to work with senior partners and do legal research, conduct client interviews and create case documents, including legal complaints, summons, and deposition summaries. I was also responsible for handling interactions with district attorneys, opposing council, judges, and court officials to establish collaborative relationships and open lines of communication.
With more than eight years of experience as a legal assistant, I am sensitive to the need for demonstrating the highest levels of integrity and maintaining strict confidentiality for clients and colleagues alike.

57,LVN Cover Letter,"Afghan, emergent, registered, short, regular","I am pleased to apply for the position of LVN at Centurion Medical. I worked as an EMT before I joined the military and during my time as a medic in Afghanistan the last two years of my deployment. After those experiences, I decided I wanted to go to medical school and focus on emergency medicine for the VA.
I realize that LVN work is not necessarily emergency medicine. A large part of my EMT work and my time as an Army medic consisted of run-of-the mill, non-emergent treatment. In addition to being a medic, I worked in an Afghan clinic during off-hours. Though the town was in the middle of a war zone, I logged more than 150 hours treating the townspeople for regular colds, fevers and broken bones. I also went to their homes and treated them when they were not able to travel to the clinic.
One of the reasons I wanted to become a Licensed Vocational Nurse is that it is a slightly different area than certified nursing assistant or registered nurse. I am able to take on more responsibilities than a CNA, such as giving injections and starting IVs. I have not decided if I want to continue to RN or stay an LVN while I work toward medical school.
One of the lessons I learned in the military is that life is short. Regardless of my job, be it EMT, medic, LVN or doctor, it's important to help people in any way I can. Medicine is the way I choose to help. I hope to get the opportunity to work with Centurion Medical in my journey. I appreciate your time and consideration.

I am especially eager to work for a company that is known for its cutting-edge accommodations and attention to detail that has been recognized in the leading property journals in the country.
I have over four years of experience in directing a staff of individuals in the areas of HVAC, carpentry, drywall, electrical, plumbing, appliances and exterior structural repair. I have proficient knowledge in fire suppression and irrigation systems as well as certification in electrical and plumbing repair with the state. I am open to working a flexible schedule and pride myself on my regular and timely attendance including responding to emergencies and being on-call for property issues that occur at any time of the day or night.
In my current position at Innovation Buildings, I have not only been responsible for the daily maintenance of the properties, but I am responsible for reviewing the maintenance budget and creating expense reports in Microsoft Office Suite. I take pride in my strong written and verbal communication skills and have been recognized by management for this skill. This includes communicating with residents as well as maintenance labor to ensure that all aspects of the property environment are running smoothly.

59,Maintenance Technician Cover Letter,"inquisitive, fair, trusted, likely, prior","I am greatly excited at the prospect of becoming a Maintenance Technician at Foundry Construction Corp. I've always enjoyed working with my hands, building things, repairing them, taking them apart and putting them back together again. I'm familiar with the workings of all kinds of mechanical and electronic devices likely to be found in most buildings, such as air conditioners, refrigerators, radiators, heating systems, microwaves, stoves, plumbing systems and more. My mechanical inclinations make me an excellent fit for this position. Working for Foundry would not only be an excellent opportunity for me to be of service to people who need a handyman, but it would also allow me to do something that I quite simply enjoy doing anyway.
My prior work experience involves me being a plumber and Maintenance Technician for different companies. It is in part through working with so many different devices that I acquired my broad base of mechanical knowledge. However, I have an excellent mechanical intuition as well, which allows me to quickly figure out the inner workings of devices, even those I'm not familiar with.
I also have a fair amount of management and organizational experience under my belt. When working at Centurion Landscaping and Carpentry, I oversaw a small team of workers, and it was my responsibility to communicate with them, delegate tasks to them all and oversee each project as it was progressing.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be honored to put my skills and inquisitive mind to work for you and become a trusted member of your team at Foundry Construction. As we move ahead through the hiring process, I look forward to proving that I can be trusted to ensure the devices and buildings that clients ask me to examine remain in good working order.

60,Maintenance Worker Cover Letter,"photographic, tricky, impeccable, varied, old","Flagship Engineering has an impeccable reputation in our community, and I would be thrilled to become a part of this team as a Maintenance Worker. For three years, I have worked in the maintenance department at a small manufacturing plant. Because the plant was small, I received a lot of varied experience. I'm excited to get the chance to apply what I have learned to the maintenance department at Flagship.
Maintenance is more than just knowing how to use tools. I have an innate ability to diagnose a problem and intuitively know the steps required to fix it. At age 7, I was fixing my own bike and those of the neighborhood kids. By age 10, my father allowed me to start tinkering with an old truck he had. By the time I entered high school, I could take apart and reassemble any type of machine. After high school, I immediately entered the field of maintenance at my current job. After three months on the job, I had pinpointed and fixed a problem with one of their machines that had been ongoing for years.
When presented with a new tool, I only need a few minutes to figure out the mechanics of using it. When I take apart a machine, I have an almost photographic memory of where each part goes, so I can put it back together correctly. I am self-driven and don't mind putting in extra hours to solve a particularly tricky problem.
Thank you for considering my application. I'm excited to learn more about the duties required as a Maintenance Worker at Flagship. I look forward to helping diagnose problems and fixing them as quickly as possible. My future goal is to be promoted to supervisor and then to manager so that I can bring my problem-solving skills to the next level.

A successful marketing campaign is crucial to the long-term success of any company, and I believe that my unique skill set is perfect for this job.
I have previously worked in the Marketing department at River Tech, and I oversaw a wide variety of successful marketing campaigns. My primary goal was to increase brand awareness and reach new clients through social media, SEO practices, and traditional advertising platforms. Each marketing campaign was successful in raising interest and interaction with potential clients. I was able to achieve each marketing goal by working with other employees in a team-focused environment.
Reaching marketing goals is always a top priority, and I am always looking out for the best interests of the company. I enjoy delivering marketing presentations to potential clients and focusing on the strengths of an organization. My marketing skills at River Tech enabled the company to experience new levels of success and a 45% increase in customer engagement. I am never satisfied with the status quo, and I believe that a company should continually look for ways to improve and reach new clients through innovative campaigns.
Thank you for taking the time to read my cover letter. I hope to speak with you soon and learn more about the opportunities for a Marketing position at Retail Ocean. Working in the marketing field is a fantastic opportunity, and I believe that I am a great fit at Retail Ocean with my unique skill set and prior experience.

I have worked as a Medical Office Manager for the past five years and would like the opportunity to talk to you about your open position. I have a bachelor's degree in business management, and I am currently working on my master's degree.
I have worked in health care for nearly 20 years. Most of that that time was spent in small physician offices, often for only one doctor. There were times when I did every job other than actually seeing the patient, but I have also managed up to five other employees. My ability to keep the offices running smoothly allowed my doctors to focus on caring for patients.
Keeping things organized comes second nature to me. I did billing and coding for two of the offices I worked in, so I have dealt with pharmacies, insurance companies, drug sales representatives and family members of our patients. I have been fortunate to work with people who taught me something with each visit. By moving into the city after living in a small town for so long, I look forward to bringing small-town charm with me to help keep patients calm in a hectic world.
The experiences I bring with me would complement all that I would learn as an employee of Centurion Medical. I am open to learning new things and have 20 years of health care experience behind me. I would like to offer my services for the foreseeable future and look forward to hearing from you. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Working in the medical records department at a hospital like yours is a great opportunity as I work toward a nursing degree with evening classes at St. Helena University. Learning about how the medical records department works will be a step toward understanding how to best take care of patients with various conditions throughout the duration of their illness or injury.
I have worked in the medical records departments at two other hospitals, each with a slightly different way of doing things. Learning various methods to do the same job has made me more flexible and open to new ideas. Comparing these systems allowed me, in my last job, to suggest changes in record formatting that reduced paperwork errors by 20% over the first year of implementation.
In addition to my previous work at other hospitals, I have worked as a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity in the field as well as doing work for Doctors Without Borders as a virtual assistant. With each opportunity, I learned to organize my time and to work well with many types of people. Those experiences also taught me how medical treatment differs and how to merge methods and ideas based on a patient's belief system.
I look forward to discussing my experience further with you at your earliest convenience. I believe that I can be a great asset to maintaining your hospital's sterling reputation for quality of care. My nursing education coupled with my professional and volunteer histories offer a unique perspective to medical recordkeeping. I would be honored to share my ideas on how to maintain and improve upon your record keeping systems.

I was responsible for all stages of patient care, including admitting patients, examining medical histories, ordering tests, diagnosing conditions, designing treatment plans, prescribing medication and educating patients on their condition and care program. I received specialized training in conducting exercise, Persantine and Lexiscan nuclear stress tests, and I later served as Training Team Leader for these tests.
I had the opportunity to pioneer the use of new technology to improve physician-patient interactions and drive successful business outcomes for River Tech. I spearheaded the design and implementation of our ""I Heart Health"" mobile app, which allowed clinical teams to deliver educational materials and medication reminders directly to patients' devices. As a result of this initiative, we saw a 36% increase in medication compliance and a 62% decrease in follow-up appointment cancellations.
I would like to thank you for considering me for the Nurse Practitioner position. I hope to talk with you soon about Cloud Clearwater's approach to enhancing patient care.

It was my duty to report any suspicious activity, and I avidly removed trespassers from company property. I also did preventative maintenance and open and closed the building. I monitored hallways and conference rooms onscreen from the security office.
As a Marine Corps veteran, I understand the importance of safety. In the Marine Corps, safety was especially stressed when handling firearms. I am well-trained in gun safety, which I believe to be a vital part of an armed security guard's job. I also believe in the importance of physical fitness as a security guard. I have made it a priority to keep up with my physical training so that I can perform efficiently in case of an emergency. I am a graduate of the Marine Corps Police Academy, which produces highly qualified individuals to protect the Corps and civilians.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing more about River Tech. I am confident that my background and experience, along with my desire to protect others, will prove me successful in the Security position.

My analytical skills, my penchant for being systematic and the ease with which I can do math in my head are extremely useful qualities to have in an engineer, and they are qualities that I think would make me a valuable member of the engineering team over at Flagship.

95,Therapist Cover Letter,"curious, gifted, pharmacological, empathetic, psychiatric","I am pleased to apply for the position of therapist at Centurion Mental Health Services. People have always been a source of fascination for me. I have always been both naturally empathetic and voraciously curious, and the combination of these two qualities created a strong desire to understand the inner workings of the human mind. I sought to use my knowledge to help those who are suffering. It has been a privilege to devote my professional life to helping people in that way.
I completed my doctorate in Psychology at St. Helena University. Though I have extensive knowledge of the effects and uses of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of mental disorders, I have chosen to focus the bulk of my professional energy on talk therapy.
After becoming a licensed therapist, I began practicing at the Innovation Mental Health and Brain Sciences Institute. There, groups of trained psychologists, psychiatrists and cognitive scientists would work to conduct research on the brain to discern the origins of various mental illnesses like depression and schizophrenia. In particular, my role was to meet with patients, hold talk therapy sessions with them to try and discover the source of their mental illnesses, provide them with insight into their own conditions. When needed, I would ask psychiatric colleagues to prescribe medication. Most of the time, I would simply be there for them and listen to their problems. I took detailed notes during each session with each patient and compiled extensive documentation on them in an effort to help them. With my strong interpersonal skills, I would try to get to the heart of what was troubling my patients while making sure to always treat them with compassion. With my help, as many as 70% of patients with all but the most serious conditions would return to living productive lives within a year.
I thank you for your time and attention in considering me for this position. It would be an honor to be able to work alongside the gifted professionals at Centurion to help patients. I looking forward to proceeding further through the hiring process and becoming a trusted member of your team.

98,Tutor Cover Letter,"retired, worth, correct, useful, extra","I'm excited to be applying as a Tutor at Centurion Medical School. I can't wait to begin helping students study and learn as they navigate medical school. I know that medical school is a challenging time and I can provide the calming influence and extra boost that certain students need. My passion for learning and teaching shines through to the students as they become excited and motivated to reach their goals.
I am a retired teacher with 32 years of experience teaching various science subjects to high school students. This background enables me to be able to help tutor students who are struggling with the science component of their education. Teaching difficult subjects has definitely taught me patience. There is no greater joy for me than to patiently guide a student to the correct answer. When a student has that ""aha!"" moment, all my efforts are worth it.
The Common Core standards are a useful yardstick for measuring how well students are doing. My students consistently met or exceeded the Common Core standards for science. I believe in working with each student's individual learning styles to help them understand the material. If students were struggling with a concept, I would figure out a different way to teach or apply that concept. I was voted Teacher of the Year six times in my career. I also won an award for Innovative Teaching Style at the 2011 National Teaching Conference.
Thank you for considering my application as a Tutor. I'm looking forward to hearing from you and discussing educational standards and the need for qualified tutors in medical school. Even though I'm retired, I still complete continuing education credits as a way to keep my brain limber and not be out of the educational loop. I am excited to apply my many years of teaching experience to help new students with difficult subjects.
